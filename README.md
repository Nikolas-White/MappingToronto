# __Mapping Toronto: Visualizing Amenities__

### __Project Overview__
This project aims to analyze and visualize Toronto's urban landscape through its amenities like restaurants, cafes, parks, and schools. This helps in understanding urban dynamics, which is crucial for urban planning and community services enhancement.

### __Dataset__
The datasets used in this project are sourced from the City of Toronto's Open Data portal and OpenStreetMap:
- **Toronto Neighborhood Profiles**: Provides demographic data for each neighborhood in Toronto, including population, income, and more.
- **OpenStreetMap Data**: Offers detailed data on various amenities located throughout Toronto.
The demographic data can be accessed via the Toronto Open Data portal, and the amenities data can be queried directly using the osmnx Python library from OpenStreetMap.

### __Requirements__
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- folium
- geopandas
- osmnx

### __Usage__
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts located in the `src/` directory to perform data analysis and visualization.
- Review the visualizations saved in the `visualizations/` directory.

### __Acknowledgements__
This project uses data provided by:
- The City of Toronto Open Data portal, available for public use.
- OpenStreetMap, which is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.
